        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello, visitors. Welcome to my website! I put it together myself originally for just a simple communication class. But I plan to continue to update it and improve it, to have an easy link to everything anyone might need to (reasonably) know about me. On the site you can find out about my interests, my hobbies, and if you're an employer, you can find my resume as well; arguably the most important part of the vetting process. All of this, and maybe some things I forgot to mention, put together here for your (and my) convenience.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Amir Stephens</strong>. I am a 3rd year, <em>Computer Science</em> student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I do often double as an IT student to the public eye, but I promise you that they are two different things. I have recently been trying to rediscover my passions, interests, and overall my love for programming. This website is just one of the few things that have come out of that journey of self discovery.</p>
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mark of The Ninja</li>
            <li>Vampire: The Masquerade - Shadows of New York</li>
            <li>Fights in Tight Spaces</li>
            <li>Fortnite</li>
            <li>Sifu</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Movies & Tv Shows</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Iron Man</li>
            <li>500 Seconds of Summer</li>
            <li>Maid</li>
            <li>The Legends of Vox Machina</li>
            <li>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Evil Side - The Dirty Nil</li>
            <li>Chivalry Is Not Dead</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was seven years old I have wanted to do something with Artifical Inteliigence. Through my short exposure to the Compouter Science field, I have learned the concepts I need to get an understanding on if I want to achieve my dreams. Those topics are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and finally Artifical Intelligence. My goal is that within a couple of months, I will be ready to take part in Machine Learning compititions to hone my craft.</p>

        <p>Something that most self respcting Computer Scienstist do is... Program. That's something I haven't really done for myself in a while. I plan to be making many projects. Currently I am working with python on two projects. One is an alarm clock project which uses Tkinker and another is a game using pygame. I also do a bunch of leetcode on the side for interviews...</p>

        <p>With all of the above mentioned, I planned to improve this website so much more. I don't know what I want to do but this is certainly only the first version of this website. I plan to add a section for my projects most likely and anything else I'll do, I'll add a section for it. My goal is to maintain this website regularly!</p>
